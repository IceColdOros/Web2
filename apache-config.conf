# This is NOT a standalone file Apache reads by default.
# You need to place these directives inside a <VirtualHost> block
# or your main server configuration file (like apache2.conf or httpd.conf).

<Directory /var/www/html>
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html
    # Replace /path/to/your/php/project with the actual path to your project's webroot.

    # Disable directory listing - Don't let people browse your files

    # Allow FollowSymLinks if needed, but be cautious
    # Options +FollowSymLinks

    # Set the default index file(s)
    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html

    # RewriteBase /your/subdirectory/

    # Rewrite rules for clean URLs
    # This sends all requests for non-existent files/directories to index.php
    # You'll likely need to adjust this based on your routing logic in PHP

    # Ensure PHP files are handled by the PHP module
    # This is usually handled automatically if mod_php is enabled and configured,
    # but sometimes you might need specific handlers depending on your setup (e.g., FPM).
    # Example (often not needed if mod_php is configured correctly):
    # AddHandler application/x-httpd-php .php

    # Optional: Configure logging for this directory/virtual host
    # ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    # CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

    # Optional: Force HTTPS (uncomment and adjust if needed)
    # Requires mod_ssl to be enabled
    # RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
    # RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
